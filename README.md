# Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose
Accountaibility Accounting, a hypothetical investment bank, wants to offer a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio and want a report that includes the cryptocurrencies that are currently being traded on the market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for their new investment. 

- Using unsupervised learning
- Clustering
- Reducing principal components (using PCA) and dimensions

- The data Martha will be working with is not ideal, so it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. 
- Since there is no known output for what Martha is looking for, she has decided to use unsupervised learning. 
- To group the cryptocurrencies, Martha decided on a clustering algorithm. 
- Sheâ€™ll use data visualizations to share her findings with the board
