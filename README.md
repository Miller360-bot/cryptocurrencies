# Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose
Accountaibility Accounting, a hypothetical investment bank, wants to offer a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio and need a report including the cryptocurrencies that are currently being traded on the market and how they could be separated into groups. By first reducing dimensions and using the k-means algorithm, I created visualizations in order to share my findings with the board.
