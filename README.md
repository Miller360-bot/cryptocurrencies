# Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies

## Purpose
Accountaibility Accounting, a hypothetical investment bank, wants to offer a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio and want a report that includes the cryptocurrencies that are currently being traded on the market and how they could be grouped. By reducing dimensions and using the k-means algorithm, I created visualizations in order to share findings with the board.
